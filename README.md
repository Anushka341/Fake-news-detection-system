 Fake News Detection System

 Project Overview

The Fake News Detection System is an AI-powered application designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning algorithms. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text content and determine whether the news is trustworthy or not.

This project aims to help combat the growing issue of misinformation by providing an automated solution to detect and flag fake news articles. It is particularly useful in today's digital world, where misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and other online platforms.

 Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis by removing noise and irrelevant information.
- Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning models) to classify news articles as fake or real.
- Accuracy Evaluation: Implements performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
- Web Interface : Allows users to input news articles and receive predictions about their authenticity.
  
 Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language used for the project.
- Machine Learning Libraries: 
  - `scikit-learn` for training classification models
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for text processing
  - `tensorflow/keras` (optional) for deep learning models
- Data: The project uses news datasets containing labeled real and fake news articles.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites

To run the Fake News Detection System, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anushka341/Fake-news-detection-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-news-detection-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the program:
   - If you have a script for testing the model, run it using:
     ```bash
     python test_model.py
     ```
   - If you have a web interface, launch it by running:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

 Usage

Once the model is set up and running, input a news article (either manually or via the web interface) and the system will classify it as **real** or **fake** based on the model's prediction.
